Title:
    Duplicate Elements

Environment: 
    Streamlit app.py (Task list)

Bug Reproduction: 
    1. Have multiple tasks saved
    2. Delete one of the tasks in the middle (not the latest)
    3. Create and save more tasks

Expected vs Actual Results: 
    The tasks are each numbered with an id that is suppose to be unique; however, when a task is deleted and another replaces it, the task is given an id based on the number of tasks saved + 1 which causes for duplicate tasks instead of them all being unique

How to Fix it:
    Whenever tasks are deleted, have all the tasks renumbered so say there is task 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 if task 3 was deleted, the tasks would be renumbered to 1, 2, 3, 4
