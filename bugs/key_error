Title:
    KeyError

Environment: 
    Streamlit app.py (Task list)

Bug Reproduction: 
    1. Delete all tasks

Expected vs Actual Results: 
    The tasks are suppose to be able to be added and deleted without any errors; however, there were no tasks then the unittests.py was ran to make sure that the functions were working properly, a there was an error that popped up and adding other tasks did nothing either

How to Fix it:
    Only run the st.write when there a description or due_date is given otherwise, skip the function that calls it when the task does not have it
